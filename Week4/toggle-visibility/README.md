# 🔁 Toggle Visibility using useReducer in React

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Build a simple React application that toggles the visibility of a message using the `useReducer` hook. This helps understand how to manage basic state with `useReducer`.

---

## 📋 Requirements

- Initialize state with `{ isVisible: false }`
- Use `useReducer` to manage state
- Handle a `TOGGLE_VISIBILITY` action
- Show or hide "Hello, World!" based on state
- Update the message visibility on button click

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- React (via Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6)
- CSS (for styling)

---

## 📸 Demo Behavior

- The app shows a button labeled `Toggle Message`
- Clicking the button toggles the display of `"Hello, World!"`
- The message is **hidden initially**
